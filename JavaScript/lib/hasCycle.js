/**
 * Detect Cycle in Linked List
 *
 * Implement an algorithm to determine whether a singly linked list contains a cycle.
 * Given the head node of a linked list, detect if there exists a cycle where some node
 * in the list can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. The
 * challenge is to solve this using optimal O(1) constant memory space complexity.
 * Consider implementing Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (tortoise and hare approach)
 * for an elegant solution. Handle edge cases including empty lists and single-node lists.
 * The solution should efficiently process lists with up to 10^4 nodes containing values
 * from -10^5 to 10^5.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 *
 * @param {ListNode} head - Head node of the singly linked list to check for cycles
 * @returns {boolean} - True if there is a cycle in the linked list, otherwise false
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: head = [1], pos = -1
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4]
 * - -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
 * - pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list
 *
 * Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?
