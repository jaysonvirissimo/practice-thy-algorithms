/*
 * Group Anagrams
 *
 * Develop an algorithm to categorize strings into groups where each group contains
 * anagrams of each other. Given an array of strings, identify and collect all strings
 * that can be rearranged to form identical character sequences. Two strings are anagrams
 * if they contain exactly the same characters with the same frequencies, but potentially
 * in different orders. Return the grouped anagrams in any arrangement. Design an
 * efficient solution that can process up to 10^4 strings, each containing up to 100
 * lowercase English letters.
 *
 * Complexity: O(n * k log k)
 *
 * @param {string[]} strs - Array of strings to group by anagrams
 * @returns {string[][]} - Array of grouped anagrams
