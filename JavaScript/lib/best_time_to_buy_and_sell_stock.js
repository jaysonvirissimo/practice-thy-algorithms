/*
 * Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
 *
 * Determine the optimal strategy for a single stock transaction to maximize profit.
 * Given an array representing stock prices over consecutive days, identify the most
 * profitable buy-sell pair where the purchase precedes the sale. The algorithm should
 * find the maximum difference between a selling price and a buying price, with the
 * constraint that the buying day must occur before the selling day. If no profitable
 * transaction exists, return zero.
 *
 * Complexity: O(n)
 *
 * @param {number[]} prices - Array of stock prices where prices[i] represents the price on day i
 * @returns {number} - Maximum profit achievable from a single transaction
