/*
 * Three Sum
 *
 * Design an algorithm to identify all unique triplets within an integer array
 * that sum to zero. Given an array of integers, return all distinct combinations
 * of three elements where the sum equals zero and no indices are repeated.
 * The solution must eliminate duplicate triplets from the result set. Implement
 * an efficient approach that can handle arrays with up to 3000 elements containing
 * values ranging from -10^5 to 10^5.
 *
 * Complexity: O(nÂ²)
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums - Array of integers to find triplets within
 * @returns {number[][]} - Array of triplets that sum to zero
