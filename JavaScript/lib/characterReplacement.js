/**
 * Longest Repeating Character Replacement
 *
 * Develop a sliding window algorithm to determine the maximum length of a substring
 * containing identical characters that can be achieved through strategic character
 * replacements. Given a string of uppercase English letters and a limit k on the number
 * of character modifications allowed, implement an efficient solution that finds the
 * optimal substring where all characters can be made identical using at most k
 * replacements. The algorithm should employ a two-pointer technique with frequency
 * tracking to maintain a valid window and maximize the resulting substring length.
 * Design the solution to handle strings with up to 10^5 characters efficiently.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - only 26 uppercase letters
 *
 * @param {string} s - String consisting of only uppercase English letters
 * @param {number} k - Maximum number of character replacements allowed
 * @returns {number} - Length of the longest substring with repeating characters after replacements
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
 * The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * - s consists of only uppercase English letters
 * - 0 <= k <= s.length
