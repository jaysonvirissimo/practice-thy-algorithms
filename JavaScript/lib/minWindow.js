/**
 * Minimum Window Substring
 *
 * Implement an advanced sliding window algorithm to find the minimum window substring
 * that contains all characters from a target string. Given two strings s and t, where
 * s has length m and t has length n, identify the shortest contiguous substring of s
 * that includes every character from t with the correct frequency counts. The algorithm
 * must handle duplicate characters appropriately and return an empty string if no valid
 * window exists. Design an optimal solution using the two-pointer sliding window
 * technique with hash maps for character frequency tracking. The solution should achieve
 * O(m + n) time complexity and handle strings with up to 10^5 characters consisting of
 * uppercase and lowercase English letters.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(m + n)
 * Space Complexity: O(k) where k is the number of unique characters in t
 *
 * @param {string} s - Source string of length m consisting of English letters
 * @param {string} t - Target string of length n consisting of English letters
 * @returns {string} - Minimum window substring or empty string if none exists
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
 * Output: "BANC"
 * Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "a", t = "a"
 * Output: "a"
 * Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
 * Output: ""
 * Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
 * Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - m == s.length
 * - n == t.length
 * - 1 <= m, n <= 10^5
 * - s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters
 *
 * Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?
