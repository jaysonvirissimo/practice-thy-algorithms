# Take an array, and a window size w.
# Find the maximum max - min within a range of w elements.
# First solve MaxStack.
# Write a MinMaxStack to track both the min and the max in a stack.
# Next, solve StackQueue.
# Write a MinMaxStackQueue which tracks both the min and max.
# Last, use MinMaxStackQueue to solve the problem.
