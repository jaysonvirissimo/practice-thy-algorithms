# Merge Intervals
#
# Construct an algorithm to consolidate overlapping intervals within a collection.
# Given an array of intervals where each interval is represented as [start, end],
# merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of non-overlapping intervals
# that cover the entire input range. Two intervals are considered overlapping if
# they share any common points, including when one interval's end equals another's
# start. Design an efficient solution that can handle up to 10^4 intervals with
# coordinates ranging from 0 to 10^4.
#
# Complexity: O(n log n)
#
# @param [Array<Array<Integer>>] intervals Array of intervals where each interval is [start, end]
# @return [Array<Array<Integer>>] Array of merged non-overlapping intervals
