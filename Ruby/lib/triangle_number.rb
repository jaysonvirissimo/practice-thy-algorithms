# The sequence of triangle numbers.
# Triangle numbers represent expanding triangular formations.
# The Nth triangle number is N + the previous triangle number.
# The first triangle number is 1.
# The 2nd triangle number is 3, because 2 + 1 = 3.
# The third triangle number is 6 because 3 + 3 (the previous number) = 6, etc...
# Use recursion.
