# Valid Parentheses
#
# Construct an algorithm to validate the proper matching and ordering of bracket
# characters within a string. Given a string containing only parentheses, square
# brackets, and curly braces, determine whether the brackets are correctly paired
# and nested. Each opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket of
# the same type, and brackets must be closed in the proper order to maintain
# valid nesting structure.
#
# Complexity: O(n)
#
# @param [String] s String containing only bracket characters: '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', '}'
# @return [Boolean] true if brackets are valid, false otherwise
