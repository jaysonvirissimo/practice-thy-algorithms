# Three Sum
#
# Design an algorithm to identify all unique triplets within an integer array
# that sum to zero. Given an array of integers, return all distinct combinations
# of three elements where the sum equals zero and no indices are repeated.
# The solution must eliminate duplicate triplets from the result set. Implement
# an efficient approach that can handle arrays with up to 3000 elements containing
# values ranging from -10^5 to 10^5.
#
# Complexity: O(nÂ²)
#
# @param [Array<Integer>] nums Array of integers to find triplets within
# @return [Array<Array<Integer>>] Array of triplets that sum to zero
