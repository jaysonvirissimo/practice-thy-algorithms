"""
Valid Parentheses

Construct an algorithm to validate the proper matching and ordering of bracket
characters within a string. Given a string containing only parentheses, square
brackets, and curly braces, determine whether the brackets are correctly paired
and nested. Each opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket of
the same type, and brackets must be closed in the proper order to maintain
valid nesting structure.

Complexity: O(n)

Args:
    s (str): String containing only bracket characters: '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', '}'

Returns:
    bool: True if brackets are valid, False otherwise
