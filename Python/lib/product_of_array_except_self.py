"""
Product of Array Except Self

Construct an algorithm that generates an output array where each element
represents the product of all input array elements excluding the element at
the current index position. The solution must operate in O(n) time complexity
without utilizing division operations. Design the algorithm to handle arrays
containing up to 10^5 elements with values ranging from -30 to 30, ensuring
all intermediate and final products remain within 32-bit integer bounds.

Complexity: O(n)

Args:
    nums (list): Array of integers where each element contributes to products at other indices

Returns:
    list: Array where each element is the product of all others
