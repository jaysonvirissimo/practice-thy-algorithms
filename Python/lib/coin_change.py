# Coin Change
# Construct an algorithm that determines the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given monetary amount. Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, return an array containing the specific coins that sum to the target using the fewest possible coins. Implement this as a classic dynamic programming optimization problem.
# Time complexity: O(amount * coins).
