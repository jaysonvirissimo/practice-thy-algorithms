Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Determine the optimal strategy for a single stock transaction to maximize profit.
Given an array representing stock prices over consecutive days, identify the most
profitable buy-sell pair where the purchase precedes the sale. The algorithm should
find the maximum difference between a selling price and a buying price, with the
constraint that the buying day must occur before the selling day. If no profitable
transaction exists, return zero.

Complexity: O(n)

Args:
    prices (List[int]): Array of stock prices where prices[i] represents the price on day i

Returns:
    int: Maximum profit achievable from a single transaction
