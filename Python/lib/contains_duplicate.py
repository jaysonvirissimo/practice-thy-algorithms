"""
Contains Duplicate

Analyze an integer array to determine whether any value appears more than once.
Return true if at least one duplicate exists, false if all elements are distinct.
Design an efficient solution that can handle arrays with up to 100,000 elements
containing values in the range of negative one billion to positive one billion.

Complexity: O(n)

Args:
    nums (List[int]): Array of integers to check for duplicates

Returns:
    bool: True if duplicates exist, False if all elements are distinct
