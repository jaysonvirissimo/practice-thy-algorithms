This repository includes a series of tests that can be used for practicing algorithms in the _Javascript_ and _Ruby_ programming languages.
To get started, just clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/jaysonvirissimo/practice-thy-algorithms.git`.

## JavaScript Instructions
Make sure you have the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) package manager installed on your system.
Navigate to the `JavaScript` directory and run `yarn install`.
The problem statements are inside the appropriately named file in `lib`.
This is also where you write your own code.
Run `yarn test` when you are ready for some feedback on your attempt.

## Ruby Instructions
Write your solutions in `algorithms.rb` and run the `rspec` command in the `Ruby` directory.
