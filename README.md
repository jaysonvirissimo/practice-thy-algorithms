This repository includes a series of tests that can be used for practicing algorithms in the _Javascript_, _Python_, and _Ruby_ programming languages.
To get started, clone this repo locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/jaysonvirissimo/practice-thy-algorithms.git
```

## JavaScript Instructions
Make sure you have the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager installed.
Navigate to the `JavaScript` directory and run `npm install`.
The problem statements are inside the appropriately named files in `lib`.
This is also where you write your own code.
Run `npm test` when you are ready for some feedback on your attempt.

## Python Instructions
Ensure Python is installed.
Navigate to the `Python` directory.
Add your solutions in the `lib` directory.
Run the tests with `python -m unittest discover -s test`.

## Ruby Instructions
Make sure you have `bundler` installed.
Navigate to the `Ruby` directory and run `bundle install`.
The problem statements are inside the appropriately named file in `lib`.
This is also where you write your own code.
Run `rspec` when you are ready for some feedback on your attempt.
